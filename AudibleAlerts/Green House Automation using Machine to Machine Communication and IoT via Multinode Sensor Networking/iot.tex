\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
Farming has been an activity humans have been involved in for a long period of time. The global population is growing rapidly, necessitating a greater output of food production. The traditional approach necessitates more manpower and water. Since agriculture has a great contribution in the overall economic development of a nation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Automation plays a crucial role in smart agriculture. Automation is  one of the oldest concepts in electronics field that incorporate with agriculture field.\\
This greenhouse automation is a software which is created to automate the actions of the technical installations installed within the green house. This computerized greenhouse monitoring system employs a selection of detectors to track and assess the runoff for you. \\
The information collected can be employed to guarantee following of any local laws if necessary and provide an accurate assessment of expenditure. It is not possible to adequately adjust all the elements that have an impact on the growth of your crops and, thus, your harvest by manually controlling them. That is why we recommend that you get a decent controller for your greenhouse. This will take away the guesswork from the task. Furthermore, an impressive automation system will monitor the atmosphere, your root zone, notify you when any issue arises and offer you the capability to manage everything from a distance through any device.
In this project an automated agriculture system is developed to optimize the water and other resources of the crops. In addition, the lack of water and the concerning climate changes necessitate the implementation of more effective techniques for contemporary agricultural grounds. Therefore, it is essential to implement automation and utilize intelligent decision making in order to achieve this aim.\\ As technology advances, methods such as ubiquitous computing, satellite surveillance, Radio Frequency Identifier, wireless ad-hoc networks, sensor networks, remote sensing, the Internet of Things, context-aware computing, and cloud computing are becoming vastly more commonplace.
Most of these automations are workings with the codes programmed on the  controller board. After this automated systems, IoT concept is added in the internet era to monitor parameters and trigger the actuators from anywhere in the world using a smartphone application. We are creating an alternate program to the regular farming procedure. This new system will allow farmers to gain insight into the condition of their land even when they are not physically present in the area. They will be able to gain this knowledge from any location in the world.
In case of large fields, a single controller can’t take data from sensors placed in a wide area of lands through wires. Even if we increase the data transmission cables length with a high-quality copper wire there must be some data loss due to copper loss. \\To overcome this problem, we need to develop multiple nodes of wireless network that can communicate each other through some media like internet. our project will help the farmers by reducing the human interaction towards the agricultural tools and also controls the expenditure towards maintenance. We are developing a smart agriculture system to optimise the water and other resources for the crop. Here we use a single controller that has some set of sensors and actuators like moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, PH sensor, Motor Pumps, Draft Fans etc.



\section{Motivation}\\
\\Passing down farming knowledge from one generation to the next is no longer sufficient, since the world is changing at an unprecedented rate and the demands on the agricultural industry are ever-growing while the techniques remain the same. 
The amount of individuals close to experiencing hunger and malnourishment is rapidly increasing. We need modern solutions to modern problems So what has this got to do with an automated Greenhouse? For upcoming farming technologies the greenhouse has been set up as a low budget testing system. In the farming sector,  the Internet of Things (IoT) is more essential than ever. Smart greenhouses are a perfect illustration of this.As the unpredictability intensifies, growers are turning to advanced technologies to boost their production efficiency and the crop resilience is not a big surprise.

\section{Purpose And Research Question}\\
\\The goal of creating this Agricultural Automation System is to reduce the need for manual labour and the associated socioeconomic circumstances. In many countries these days, there is a tendency for people to move towards towns, mainly because farming has become a difficult occupation and farmers do not make enough money. Additionally, there is a shortage of skilled labour in the agricultural sector, which negatively affects the nation's economic situation. This is one of the main reason for automating the agricultural sector. Data from recent times illustrates that the growth rate of farmers in India has decreased during the last ten years, resulting in a decrease in the production of rice. Through the automation of agricultural processes, individuals can keep a close eye on the farming process even when they are not physically present in the field. In order to increase the output and quality of agriculture products, our proposed automated agriculture system helps in the use of highly precise farming techniques in combination with the latest technological innovations for agricultural practices. It also adds up to one more advantage of reducing heavy labour. Many businesses are transitioning to automation, and farming is no exception. From seed sowing to harvesting, almost every part of farming can be automated by the technological advancements. Farming is a labour-intensive process, with similar tasks being carried out repeatedly, making it a great option for automation. There has been progress in the development of Agri-Bots which can perform multiple farming activities such as planting, irrigating, gathering, and tracking. This modern age of intelligent agriculture is the response to the demand for increased food production with fewer human resources. This project is focused on a automation process that uses specialized equipment and incorporated software that could be advantageous to farming operations.


\section{Problem Statement}\\
\\
 • Most of these automation works with respect to codes programmed.\\
•  After this automated systems, IoT concept is added in the internet era using smartphone application.\\
• In case of large fields, a single controller can’t take data from sensors that placed in a wide area of lands through wires.\\
• To overcome this problem,we need to develop multiple nodes of wireless network that can communicate each other through some media like internet.\\
\\
\section{Approach and Methodology}\\
\\
In this project we are going to develop 3 separate nodes for execute our task. Node 1 and 2 have the ability to sense several parameters like soil moisture, temperature, light intensity and humidity. We are using DHT sensor (Digital Humidity and Temperature) for sensing humidity  and temperature  inside a green house. \\A pair of analogue soil moisture sensor is added for sense moisture from soil and an LDR based light sensor for sense the presence of sunlight inside green house. The 3rd node has the ability to actuate several tasks by following the instruction from the 1st and 2nd node. Node 3 can able to supply water (as artificial rain), Temperature controlling by drafting hot air from the green house and artificial growth light controlling ability. Here there is a 4th invisible node, it is a backend server for managing conversation between the 3 nodes.\\ Here we are going to use Google Firebase as our backend server. Which can help us prevent data missing obtained during communication between node 1, 2 and 3 due to buffering issue. An android app is also here to monitor the sensor reading from node 1 2 and actuate the tasks operated by node 3 from any corner of the world with only an active internet connection. We are using Wemos D1 SoC based controller board for develop Node 1,2 and 3. We can easily connect them to a Wi-Fi hotspot using two line of codes to establish internet connection\\

\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section{In Paper[1]} \\
Water is a fundamental natural asset for farming, but we understand that it is limited. All living beings on this planet require water. As the population has raised drastically, and water is being utilized more, fresh water has turned out to be a significant resource. Smart irrigation systems should be employed to make irrigation more effective in this sector with the goal that water is used efficiently .This system has been developed to measure the moisture and humidity of the soil and then to utilize a selection of machine learning methods to process the information in the cloud. Farmers are being given the relevant data regarding water requirements. Smart irrigation can enable them to carry out agricultural activities with lesser water consumption. It is essential to employ technological innovations such as smart irrigation systems to make agricultural irrigation more efficient, thereby reducing the amount of water consumed and making it more productive.\\
\section{In Paper[2]}\\ Agriculture is the main occupation in India. To make it more prosperous and beneficial, Indian farmer 
should do a scientific farming. The main aim of the project is efficient use of water and investigate, 
identify how the use of mobile phones with respect to WSN enables farmers to monitor and control 
their farm field. This concept also gives mobile interface for accessing real-time data and secure 
database so that it is helpful take good crop value by analysing past data. We have tested the soil
using soil moisture sensor. The values of soil moisture content are varying with respect to water 
content present in that soil.\\
\section{In Paper[3]}\\
To make the best use of fresh water for irrigation, it is necessary to create a clever irrigation system that relies on the prediction of soil moisture levels in the field and the precipitation information for the upcoming days. This article covers an intelligent system which anticipates soil moisture levels by looking at the data collected from sensors that have been installed in the field and the weather forecast available on the web. The field data was obtained through self-constructed sensor nodes.\\
\section{In Paper[4]}\\
Farming remains the primary occupation for half of India's population, providing their main source of income. The Agricultural sector of India is incredibly important, as it contributes an estimated 18 percentage to the country's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The most recent progressions in technology have had an effect on almost all aspects of life, and it has been used in a wide selection of applications, like smartphones, smart vehicles, and intelligent control systems. Despite the fact that technology has brought about countless improvements in various areas. Smart phones and the advancements in communication technologies have had a considerable influence on different stages and in the last few years, they have been used to keep an eye on the moisture level of the soil and the progress of crops in the agricultural sector.\\ This paper suggests an android app to help control farming machineries through the utilization of Internet of Things. This machine automation guarantees that the job is accomplished without any human intervention. The former agricultural system was equipped with an android application which was able to provide both the farmer and the soil moisture information as well as the growth of the crops. Even so, human help was needed to ensure the fields were watered and the crops were properly taken care of. The goal of this approach is to create automated machines to handle farming activities such as cultivation, irrigation, and cultivation in agricultural areas with the utilization of Internet of Things. It permits the farmers to remotely watch the machinery utilized in the farming, for example, tractors, engines, and so forth, and to control them. \\ The micro-controller incorporated into the system is programmed to guarantee that each step necessary for the plant's development is carried out accurately. Furthermore, the Zig-bee technology is employed to facilitate communication between the machines and the controller. The internet is used by the controller to send data to the farmer by way of an android app. The Wasp mote-sensors are utilized for keeping track of moisture in the soil, the level of humidity, amount of water, crop size, height, and the wind velocity, among other things. Therefore, the proposed system increases the output of crops without the need for farmer involvement.

\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
\section{Objective}
The objective of this project is to implement machine-to-machine communication in the agriculture field. The main goals include optimizing water usage, automating irrigation processes, and improving crop growth. This will be achieved by establishing communication among three nodes, each equipped with specific sensors and actuators.\\
\section{System Design} 
The system design consists of three nodes: Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3. Node 1 is equipped with a soil moisture sensor, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor. Node 2 has a soil moisture sensor and a light intensity sensor. Node 3 contains a pair of motor pumps, an exhaust fan, and a growth light, all of which are controlled using a 4-channel solenoid valve. All three nodes are connected to a Google Firebase database for seamless data exchange. The nodes are controlled using an ESP8266-based Wemos D1 controller board, and they feature OLED displays to visualize information from the Firebase database. Additionally, an Android app is developed to monitor readings and control the nodes remotely.\\
\section{Node Configuration}
Each node is configured with the necessary hardware and software components. This includes connecting the sensors, actuators, and the Wemos D1 controller board. The OLED displays are set up to show real-time information from the Firebase database, providing easy access to data for monitoring purposes.
\section{Firebase Integration} 
To enable data exchange, a connection is established between the nodes and the Firebase database. The appropriate API calls or libraries are implemented to facilitate communication. Emphasis is placed on ensuring proper authentication and security measures to protect the data.
\section{Data Collection}
Code is implemented on each node to periodically read sensor data. Node 1 and Node 2 collect soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity readings. The collected data is stored in the Firebase database for further analysis and processing.
\section{Event Detection} 
Algorithms are developed to detect specific events based on the sensor readings. These events include low soil moisture, high temperature, and darkness. Logic is implemented to trigger corresponding actions based on the detected events.
\section{Data Reporting}
Each node is configured to report events and relevant data to Node 3 through the Firebase database. For example, when Node 1 detects low soil moisture, it sends a signal to Node 3 to activate the corresponding pump. Similarly, when Node 1 detects high temperature, it reports to Node 3 to turn on the exhaust fan. 
\section{Actuator Control}
The control logic is implemented on Node 3 to receive event signals from Node 1 and Node 2. The actuators (pumps, exhaust fan, growth light) are controlled using the Wemos D1 controller board and the 4-channel solenoid valve. Node 3 responds appropriately to the events reported by Node 1 and Node 2, ensuring efficient operation of the system.        
\section{Android App Development}
An Android app is developed to provide remote monitoring and control capabilities. The app is integrated with the Firebase database to fetch real-time data. User-friendly interfaces are implemented to display sensor readings and allow manual control of the nodes when needed.
\section{Testing and Validation} 
A thorough testing process is conducted to validate the system's functionality. Sensor readings are verified for accuracy, communication between nodes through the Firebase database is tested, and the response of the actuators to the reported events is evaluated. The Android app is also tested to ensure proper monitoring and control of the nodes.
\section{Deployment and Optimization}
After successful testing, the nodes are installed in the agriculture field. They are properly powered and connected to the Wi-Fi network for continuous operation. The system's performance is monitored over time, and necessary adjustments are made to optimize its efficiency.

\chapter{CONCLUSION}

Our system let people to monitor and manage raising scenarios of their greenhouse. Yield of the land could be improved. By utilizing sensor nodes, cloud computing, and an internet connection, people will be able to receive real-time updates about their plants, allowing them to grow plants in a more cost-effective way. Through the observations and results of traditional tests, it has been concluded that this project will provide a solution for automating activities within greenhouses and for irrigation, thus leading to the development of a smart irrigation system and smart farming. Putting this system into practice in the agriculturally-based sectors can certainly aid in raising the yield of crops and total output, as well as being cost-effective so that the majority of farmers and related industries can access it. Weariness of the farmers can also be reduced.
